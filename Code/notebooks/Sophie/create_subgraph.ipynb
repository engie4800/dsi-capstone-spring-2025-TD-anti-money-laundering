        "\n",
        "This notebook creates a smaller, focused version of a large transaction dataset to make it easier to use for graph machine learning. Training a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on the full dataset takes a long time — for example, training on the **HI-Small_Trans.csv** dataset from [IBM's AML dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/ibm-transactions-for-anti-money-laundering-aml) reportedly took over 21 hours ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16424)). To make experimentation faster and more efficient, we aim to create a representative **subset of about 25%** of the original data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Subsetting strategy:\n",
        "- We want to avoid having **orphan transactions** (edges with no nearby structure), since GNNs learn best from connected neighborhoods.\n",
        "- Following our instructor’s suggestion, we also include **all illicit transactions** in the subset. This ensures we preserve rare but important examples of money laundering, which would otherwise be heavily underrepresented or entirely missed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Here's what this notebook does:\n",
        "- Builds a graph where each transaction is a directed edge between two accounts.\n",
        "- Identifies all transactions labeled as **illicit** (i.e., money laundering cases).\n",
        "- Gathers nearby transactions using a **k-hop neighborhood search** to capture context around illicit activity.\n",
        "- Samples additional **licit transactions** (non-illicit) and collects some of their surrounding transactions as well.\n",
        "- Merges these parts to form a **smaller, well-connected subset** — about 25% of the full dataset.\n",
        "- Ensures everything stays properly aligned, even when there are **multiple transactions between the same accounts**.\n",
        "- Prepares the final subset for saving and future use in GNN training.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process gives us a smaller dataset that still contains meaningful structure and rare illicit behavior, making it ideal for building and testing a GNN baseline model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output\n",
        "Dataset `subset_transactions.csv`:\n",
        "* 1250901 transactions (24.6% of HI-Small.csv)\n",
        "* 0.414% of transactions are illicit (vs ~0.1% in HI-Small)"
