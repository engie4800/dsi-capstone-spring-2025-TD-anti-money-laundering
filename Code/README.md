# Project Code

The project source code is organized into the following components.

## Notebooks

At each step in the project, team members create and use Jupyter
notebooks for exploratory data analyses, for prototyping models, etc.
These notebooks are kept in the `notebooks/` directory and, for the
most part, organized by team member.

## Shared Code

Shared project source code is stored in the `src/` directory. Its
organization will evolve as the project progresses, but ultimately all
of the code required for the final project report, and for the final
model, will be organized under `src/`
